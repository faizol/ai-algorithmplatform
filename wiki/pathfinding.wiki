    The M2M Pathfinding Algorithm</p>
<p>
    Macro-to-micro (M2M) model is an implementation model that inherits the GrC idea 
    and extends it to some additional highly desirable characteristics. In this 
    paper we introduce an effective pathfinding algorithm based on the M2M model. 
    This algorithm takes O(n) time to preprocess, constructing the M2M data 
    structure. Such hierarchical structure occupies O(n) bit memory space and can be 
    updated in O(1) expected time to handle changes. Although the resulting path is 
    not always the shortest one, it can make a trade-off between accuracy and time 
    cost by adjusting a parameter - range value to satisfy various applications. At 
    last, we will discuss the advantages of the M2M pathfinding algorithm (M2M-PF) 
    and demonstrate the academic and applied prospect of M2M model.</p>
